5.Technology: What is an IP address?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.

Key Points:
Purpose: Identifies the device and provides its location on the network, allowing data to be sent to and from the correct destination.

Format:

IPv4: Expressed as four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

IPv6: Longer hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334) to accommodate more devices.

Types:

Public IP: Assigned by ISPs for external internet communication.

Private IP: Used within local networks (e.g., home or office).

Function: Acts like a digital “mailing address” for network communication and routing.

In short, an IP address is essential for devices to communicate and exchange data over networks like the internet.

Size, color, shape (e.g., a large box, red apple)

Quantity or number (e.g., three books, many people)

Characteristics or qualities (e.g., a happy child, an interesting story)

In short, adjectives help specify or clarify which one, what kind, or how many in relation to the noun or pronoun they modify.

Congress is responsible for making federal laws, declaring war, regulating interstate and foreign commerce, and overseeing the federal budget.

10.General: What color is the sky on a clear day?

On a clear day, the sky appears blue to the human eye.

This occurs because of Rayleigh scattering — sunlight interacts with molecules in Earth's atmosphere, scattering shorter (blue) wavelengths of light more effectively than longer (red/orange) wavelengths.
